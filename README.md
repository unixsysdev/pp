# Enterprise Programming Language

A modern, statically-typed programming language designed for enterprise applications with advanced type safety, memory management, and concurrency features.

## Features

- **Strong Static Typing**: Type inference with explicit type annotations
- **Memory Safety**: Compile-time guarantees and pluggable memory management
- **Error Handling**: Result/Option types for safe error handling
- **Concurrency**: Built-in async/await and actor model support
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and LLVM backend (planned)
- **Tooling**: Comprehensive development tools and IDE support

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Run examples:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Language Syntax Example

```rust
fn fibonacci(n: number) -> number {
    if (n <= 1) {
        n;
    } else {
        fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

let result: Option<number> = Some(fibonacci(10));
match result {
    Some(value) => print(value),
    None => print("No value")
}
```

## Development Roadmap
